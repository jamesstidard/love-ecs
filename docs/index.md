# Installation
A modest ECS framework for lua!

This as originally was built to work with the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org)
game framework, though nothing stops Rune ECS being used elsewhere.

## Prerequisites
This is tested on `lua v5.1`, which is the one [LÖVE](https://love2d.org)
ships with, as of writing. I'm aware newer versions of `lua` do not currently
work, due to breaking changes. I'll address this... at some point... if needed.

You'll also need a understanding of the ECS architecture, but if you're here
you probably do.

Finally, you'll need a tolerance for breaking changes, which will probably
come as soon as this gets used at all. Still deciding how I want to 
package/namespace the module, for example.

## Install
Nothing special yet, just copy and paste the `rune` directory into your
project.
